# Simple ToDo React app from Angela Yu's course.

<p> In this lesson, the goal was to create separate components for InputArea and ToDoItem to add complexity to the react Component Tree. </p>
<p> This version still keeps the Add / Remove item functionality. </p>

## Built With:
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
